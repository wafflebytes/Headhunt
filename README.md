## About the template

This template scaffolds an Auth0 + Next.js starter app. It mainly uses the following libraries:

- Vercel's [AI SDK](https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai) to handle the AI agent.
- The [Auth0 AI SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-ai-js) and [Auth0 Next.js SDK](https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0) to secure the application and call third-party APIs.
- [Auth0 FGA](https://auth0.com/fine-grained-authorization) to define fine-grained access control policies for your tools and RAG pipelines.
- Postgres with [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) and [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) to store the documents and embeddings.

It's Vercel's free-tier friendly too! Check out the [bundle size stats below](#-bundle-size).

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, clone this repo and download it locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-assistant0.git
cd auth0-assistant0/ts-vercel-ai
```

Next, you'll need to set up environment variables in your repo's `.env.local` file. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`.

- To start with the examples, you'll just need to add your NVIDIA NIM API key and Auth0 credentials for the Web app and Machine to Machine App.
  - You can set up a new Auth0 tenant with an Auth0 Web App and Token Vault following the Prerequisites instructions [here](https://auth0.com/ai/docs/get-started/call-others-apis-on-users-behalf).
  - Click on the tenant name on the [Quickstarts](https://auth0.com/ai/docs/call-your-apis-on-users-behalf), Go to the app settings (**Applications** -> **Applications** -> **WebApp Quickstart Client** -> **Settings** -> **Advanced Settings** -> **Grant Types**) and enable the CIBA grant and save.
  - For Async Authorizations, you can set up Guardian Push and Enroll the your user for Guardian following the Prerequisites instructions [here](https://auth0.com/ai/docs/async-authorization).
  - An Auth0 FGA account, you can create one [here](https://dashboard.fga.dev). Add the FGA store ID, client ID, client secret, and API URL to the `.env.local` file.
  - Optionally add a [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) API key for using web search tool.

Next, install the required packages using your preferred package manager and initialize the database.

```bash
npm install # or bun install
# start the postgres database
docker compose up -d
# create the database schema
npm run db:migrate # or bun db:migrate
# initialize FGA store
npm run fga:init # or bun fga:init
```

Now you're ready to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev  # or bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result! Ask the bot something and you'll see a streamed response:

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Backend logic lives in `app/api/chat/route.ts`. From here, you can change the prompt and model, or add other modules and logic.
